# Power BI Dashboard Creation with DAX - A Data Story

This project demonstrates a Power BI dashboard I created from scratch, inspired by a tutorial on the [Data with Decision] YouTube channel. Using DAX for advanced data analysis and visualization, this dashboard is designed to offer insights into key performance metrics for a retail company. The project showcases my data storytelling capabilities by turning raw data into meaningful, actionable insights that support business decision-making.

## Project Overview
- **Interactive Visuals**: The dashboard features drill-down capabilities that allow users to explore sales, revenue, and seasonal trends in-depth. It helps answer key questions like, "What are the primary drivers of sales?" and "How does seasonality impact revenue?"
- **Real-time Updates**: Configured for real-time updates, this dashboard ensures that users have access to the latest data, enabling timely and informed decisions.
- **Data Insights**: Through dynamic visualizations, the dashboard uncovers growth patterns and performance trends, helping users make strategic adjustments as needed.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used for custom calculations, allowing for precise and flexible insights tailored to specific business needs.
- **Power BI Data Modeling**: Designed a structured data model for efficient processing and scalability of reports.
- **Data Visualization and Storytelling**: Applied data visualization techniques to guide users through a coherent data narrative, enhancing data accessibility and comprehension.
